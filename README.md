# double_inverted_pendulum_simulation_software
This private repository contains the simulation program developed for my BSc thesis in Mechatronics Engineering at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. The simulation program investigates human balancing using a virtual double inverted pendulum system mounted on a horizontally guided cart.
